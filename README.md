**Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System**

# Problem Statement
The traditional diagnosis approach entails a patient visiting a doctor, undergoing many medical tests, and then reaching a consensus. This process is very time-consuming. This project proposes an automated disease prediction system to save time required for the initial process of disease prediction that relies on user input. The user gives input to the system and system provides the user with a prediction of their chances to tackle heart diseases and diabetes. Multi Disease Prediction” system based on predictive modeling predicts the disease of the user of the basis of the values entered by the user against specific parameters that user provides as an input to the system. The system analyzes the values provided by the user as input and gives the probability of the disease as an output.

# Introduction
This web application inputs patient vitals and based on the dataset that machine-learning model has been trained upon. It makes decisions about what likelihood the patient has of contracting the heart disease or diabetes. Here, we will deploy this project as a web app using ‘Streamlit’ in python.

# Objectives
Developing a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease or diabetes based on a set of input features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and any others.

Improving the model's performance over time by incorporating new data and incorporating new research findings.

Reducing healthcare costs by identifying patients at risk before they develop serious complications and providing them with early interventions.

Ensuring the model is robust and generalizes well to diverse populations by incorporating a diverse dataset during training.

Incorporating the ability to monitor patient progress over time and provide personalized recommendations for disease management and prevention.

Providing an easy-to-use interface for patients to access their own predictions and recommendations, and to monitor their progress over time.

Continuously evaluating the model's performance and ethical implications, and making necessary adjustments to improve its overall effectiveness and impact.
